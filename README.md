Using the concepts of data visualisation, data modelling and neural networks we deploy a model to predict stock price from taking yfinance library as our dataset.  
We present an online learning technique that employs a recurrent neural network of some sort (RNN) called Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), which uses stochastic gradient descent to update the weights for individual data points.
When compared to existing stock price prediction systems, this will yield more accurate results.
With varying sizes of data, the network is trained and evaluated for accuracy, and the results are tallied
